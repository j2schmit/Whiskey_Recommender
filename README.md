# Whiskey_Recommender
An exploration of a whiskey dataset ( https://www.mathstat.strath.ac.uk/outreach/nessie/nessie_whisky.html) from the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow Scotland, which contains a profile of 86 single malt Scotch whiskies.

 A series of multivariate analysis (aka unsupervised learning) methods have been applied with the goal of identifying groups of whiskies. Then a recommender system is developed, based off of the groupings and other dimensionality reduction techniques. The findings indicate that there are 4 clear groups. Furthermore, the groupings do not seem to indicate that region (i.e. Highlands, Islay, Speyside, etc) is highly correlated with the groups, but there is definitely some correlation.
